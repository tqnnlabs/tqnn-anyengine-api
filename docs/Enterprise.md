# TQNN Enterprise Integration & Licensing

## Why Enterprise Exists

TQNN is a sealed substrate architecture:
- spiral entanglement mesh
- GHZ cobordism inference
- qualia & intent embeddings
- phase-state decision geometry

These are protected trade secrets.  
Enterprise licensing allows access without revealing internal mechanisms.

# 🔐 Enterprise Tiers

### Tier 3 — Enterprise / Multi-Modal
- 200k+ requests/month
- private cloud cluster
- latency optimized
- burst bandwidth
- volume billing
- priority support

### Enterprise+ (Custom)
- dedicated substrate instances
- sector-specific tuning (BCI, pharma, finance)
- private inference endpoints
- on-premise deployment (hardware dependent)
- IP-safe research sandbox

# 🧠 What Enterprise Receives

- hardened gateway endpoints
- custom quota tuning
- geo-locked keys
- disaster-resistant runtime
- log-obfuscated inference traces
- no substrate exposure
- no architectural source
- no training code

---

# 🚫 What Enterprise Does *Not* Receive

- tubulin substrate model source
- GHZ phase routing code
- inference algorithm architecture
- internal weights or tensor states
- embedding reconstruction logic

These remain sealed and patent-protected.

# 🏛 Legal Status

TQNN Core Engine:
- trade secret
- patent-pending
- non-reverse-engineerable
- protected under Canadian & US trade secret law
